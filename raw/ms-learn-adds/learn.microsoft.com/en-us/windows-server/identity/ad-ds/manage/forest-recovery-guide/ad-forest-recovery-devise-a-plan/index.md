# Active Directory Forest Recovery - Devise an AD forest recovery plan

-   Applies to: ✅ [Windows Server 2025](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info), ✅ [Windows Server 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info), ✅ [Windows Server 2019](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info), ✅ [Windows Server 2016](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info)

Depending on your environment and business requirements, you may not need to perform all the steps described in this guide to perform a successful forest recovery. Given that this guide serves only as a template for forest recovery, it\'s vital that you devise a custom forest recovery plan that suits your environment and meets your business needs.

[](#plan)

## Plan {#plan .heading-anchor}

For example, in your forest recovery plan, you should have a detailed topology map of your forests. The map should list all the information about the DCs, such as their names, their roles and back up status, and the trust relationships between them.

[](#practice)

## Practice {#practice .heading-anchor}

You should practice your forest recovery plan at least once a year. Also, it\'s a good idea to perform a forest recovery drill when there are membership changes to the Enterprise Admins or Domain Admins group. This helps ensure that your information technology (IT) staff fully understands the forest recovery plan.

Documentation

-   [Active Directory Forest Recovery - Determine how to recover the forest](/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-determine-how-to-recover?source=recommendations)

    Recovering an entire Active Directory forest involves restoring at least one Domain Controller (DC) in every domain from available backup. Recovering the forest restores each domain in the forest to its state at the time of the last trusted backup. Consequently, the restore operation will result in the loss of at least the following Active Directory data\...

-   [AD Forest Recovery - Steps for Restoring the forest](/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-steps-for-restoring-the-forest?source=recommendations)

    This section provides an overview of the recommended path for recovering a forest. The forest recovery steps are described in detail later.

-   [Active Directory Forest Recovery - Prerequisites](/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-prerequisites?source=recommendations)

    The following document discusses prerequisites that you should be familiar with before devising a forest recovery plan or attempting a recovery.

-   [Active Directory Forest Recovery - Perform initial recovery](/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-perform-initial-recovery?source=recommendations)

    Beginning with a writeable DC in the forest root domain, complete the steps in this section in order to restore the first DC.

-   [Active Directory Forest Recovery - Identify the problem](/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-identify-the-problem?source=recommendations)

    When symptoms of a forest-wide failure appear, such as in event logs or other monitoring solutions, work with Microsoft Support to determine the cause of the failure and evaluate any possible remedies.

-   [Active Directory Forest Recovery Guide](/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/forest-recovery-guide/ad-forest-recovery-guide?source=recommendations)

    This guide contains recommendations for recovering an Active Directory forest if a forest-wide failure renders all DCs in the forest incapable of functioning normally.

    In certain scenarios, it may be necessary to recover only a single domain within a forest that has multiple domains, rather than a full forest recovery. This topic covers considerations for recovering a single domain and possible strategies for recovery.
